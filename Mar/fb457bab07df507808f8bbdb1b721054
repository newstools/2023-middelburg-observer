The group of children were on their way to school when they collided with a bakkie. The incident occurred on Cowen Ntuli Street between Bidvest McCarthy VW and Total Engen Krugerpark. The driver of the bakkie, Mr Dolf le Grange, told the Middelburg Observer that he and another vehicle were turning when another vehicle allegedly skipped a red robot and collided with his bakkie. A witness at the scene said two children were seriously injured and taken to the hospital. Charlene Beukes, who was at the scene, said, “There was a loud noise that was then drowned out by the screams of children.”
