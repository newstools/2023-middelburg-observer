The case against PPP Protection and Security guard Mr Brian Mchunu has been postponed due to illness. Mchunu was supposed to appear before the Middelburg Magistrate Court today (Thursday) but didn’t turn up.
A court official was sent to search for Mchunu when he didn’t arrive, and eventually, he was found sitting in his car, unable to speak. The matter was postponed to March 23 for a court decision. Mchunu is accused of killing municipal worker Tshepo Maseko last year and is facing a charge of murder. Other workers were also seriously injured during the shooting last August, where municipal workers were striking for better wages.
