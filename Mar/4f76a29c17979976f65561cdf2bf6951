Services at the Middelburg Provincial Hospital and other government departments in Middelburg are still being halted by the wage strike. The Middelburg Observer visited the hospital this morning, where workers had barricaded the hospital with burning tyres.
Desperate patients were again denied entry into the hospital. Those looking for help at the department of home affairs, department of labour and SASSA were also turned away due to the ongoing strike. The union is demanding a 10 per cent salary increase while the government is offering a 4.7 per cent increase. • Residents are also urged to steer clear of Brug Street due to students’ protesting about student funding.
