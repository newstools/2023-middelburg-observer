All hell broke loose at the Home Affairs office this morning when EFF supporters assaulted residents standing in the queue. According to one of the residents, two vehicles carrying EFF supporters stopped near the Home Affairs building and several people holding sticks and sjamboks exited the vehicles and started shouting and telling everyone to go home because of the national strike. A man was injured during the commotion. Residents standing in the long queue were angry and disappointed when they were told to leave, as no sign had been on display to inform the public that the office was closed. The Department of Home Affairs has been closed since Monday due to the national wage strike.
