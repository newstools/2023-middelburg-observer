It’s business as usual at the Middelburg Provincial Hospital, despite the strike by the National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu). The Middelburg Observer visited the hospital today, and patients were receiving medical treatment. A hospital staff member told the Observer that services have resumed and medical personnel are working as usual, only Nehawu members are striking. The workers are demanding a 10 per cent salary increase. The strike has also affected services at the Middelburg Home Affairs office, the SASSA office, the Department of Labour and the Department of Public Works. It is not clear when the strike will end.
