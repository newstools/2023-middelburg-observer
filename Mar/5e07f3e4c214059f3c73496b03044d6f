Residents are advised to remain vigilant while driving through town due to the flare up of strike action. Tyres have been placed in the centre of the Dr Beyers Naudé- and Meyer Street intersection a few minutes ago, as well as further up in Dr Beyers Naudé Drive at the SASSA offices. Eye witnesses saw the strikers arriving in a black Ford Bantam containing three men and a woman, who hastily fled the scene after setting the tyres alight. Bystanders have removed the burning tyres from the Meyer Street intersection which is currently open for traffic. Members of the SAPS are also monitoring the situation. It is suspected that the strike action is connected to the National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu) national strike.
