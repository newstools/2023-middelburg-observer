Services at hospitals in Middelburg, eMalahleni, Belfast and Mbombela have been disrupted due to the strike by the National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu). Patients have been denied services at the hospitals since Monday due to the wage strike.
Nehawu embarked on the indefinite strike to demand a 10 per cent salary increase. Workers have barricaded the entrance of the Witbank Provincial Hospital with burning tyres, fortunately, protesters in Middelburg have been peaceful.  When the Middelburg Observer visited the Middelburg hospital on Wednesday morning, workers were sitting outside and patients were allowed into the premises. The Belfast Hospital is not operating and several schools have also been closed due to safety concerns. • The Middelburg Home Affairs office, the Department of Labour and the Department of Public Works are also closed due to the strike.
