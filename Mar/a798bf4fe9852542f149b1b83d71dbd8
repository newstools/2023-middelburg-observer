The police were present at the hospital today to ensure the guards allowed patients entry. While the Middelburg Observer was visiting the hospital, a fight broke out in the middle of the road regarding the removal of a tree branch that impeded vehicles. The two men argued and threw punches, and afterwards, went and joined a group of strikers sitting in the shade.
