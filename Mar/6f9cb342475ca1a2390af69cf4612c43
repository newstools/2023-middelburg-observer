CCTV footage was obtained showing yesterday’s strike action which was momentarily escalated when tyres were used to barricade streets in Middelburg. Strikers believed to be connected to the National Education and Health Workers’ Union were seen arriving at the Dr. Beyers Naudé Drive- and Meyer Street intersection in a black Ford Bantam bakkie yesterday afternoon. The strikers barricaded the intersection with tyres and set them alight before fleeing the scene. Another blockade was also erected further up in Dr. Beyers Naudé by the SASSA offices. The intersection was rapidly cleared by bystanders, allowing traffic to flow as normal. https://www.tiktok.com/@middelburgobserver/video/7208831451813465350
