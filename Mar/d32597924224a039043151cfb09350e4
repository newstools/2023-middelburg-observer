A 41-year-old Tanzanian man, Ibrahim Kampembe, was arrested by the Mpumalanga Police  for being in possession of a stolen vehicle. The arrest was made in Hendrina. The police in the area were conducting their regular patrol when they spotted a white Toyota Fortuner. The police stopped the vehicle and searched it. During the search they discovered that the vehicle was stolen in eMalahleni in February. The police also found  40 (blank) papers which are usually used for issuing of renewals, registration and vehicle certificates. This led the police to believe that the accused  could possibly be involved in dodgy dealings involving theft of motor vehicles which are somehow frequently smuggled out of the country. When examining accused’s passport, members were further convinced that he may be one of the suspects that police could have been looking for with regard to massive theft of cars in the country. Kampembe was arrested and charged with  fraud and possession of suspected stolen property. He appeared in the  Carolina Magistrate’s Court on March 8 and the matter was postponed to March 13 for further investigation. As the investigation continues, police can not rule out the possibility of adding more charges against him in relation to the case of the theft of the motor vehicle in Witbank. The Acting Provincial Commissioner of the SAPS in Mpumalanga, Major General Zeph Mkhwanazi has expressed his gratitude for the exceptional work performed by the members which resulted in the recovery of the vehicle as well as the arrest of the suspect. “We strongly believe that through investigation, we can uncover more. We have been conducting some operations for a while surrounding the theft, robbery and hijacking of motor vehicles in the country. We really acknowledge with much appreciation the magnificent breakthrough and the work done by these members together with their counterparts from the South African International Crime Bereau” appreciated the General.
