The National Education, Health and Allied Workersâ€™ Union (Nehawu) has intensified the strike that started last Monday.
On Sunday, the union announced it would cause chaos at public institutions across the country. This morning, Nehawu in Middelburg barricaded the entrance of the Middelburg Provincial Hospital with burning tyres, making it impossible for patients, staff and ambulance personnel to enter the hospital. The strike is also affecting services at the home affairs office, the SASSA office, the department of labour and the department of public works. Last Friday, the strikers placed burning tyres near the OK centre on Meyer Street and threatened residents with sjamboks at home affairs. It is not clear when the wage strike will end. Workers are demanding a 10 per cent wage increase, while the government is offering 4.7 per cent.
