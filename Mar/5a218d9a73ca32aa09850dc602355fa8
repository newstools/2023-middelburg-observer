According to a media statement issued by the Provincial Commissioner of the SAPS, members from Middelburg Flying Squad and Visible Policing in Witbank received information from members of the public about two suspects (aged 40 and 59) who were reportedly withdrawing cash from ATMs using various SASSA cards. The two suspects were then spotted at the ATM, still busy making several withdrawals using SASSA cards and the members monitored the suspects’ movements and followed them to their Loan Shark business in the Witbank CBD. Upon arrival at the said business premises, the members conducted a search and arrested the two (male and female) after discovering that they were using SASSA cards as a guarantee for their clients who had borrowed cash from them. About 35 SASSA cards as well as undisclosed amount of cash was found and confiscated for further investigation. The two suspects are faced with a charge of contravening Section 133 of the National Credit Act 34 of 2005 and are expected to appear at the Emalahleni Magistrate’s Court today, 7 March.
