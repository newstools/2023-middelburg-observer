Senior Inspector Petro Oberholzer said a man called the SPCA and said the puppy got stuck in the drain at Samrose Village. On their arrival the SPCA realised that they could not lift the cement block on top of the drain and contacted the Middelburg Fire Brigade.
The members of the fire brigade acted immediately and used the jaws of life to pick up and shift the cement block safely out the the way.  With the help of a bystander who offered a piece of meat, they managed to coax the puppy out of the drain. â€¢ Senior Inspector Oberholzer would like to thank the Steve Tshwete Municipality, especially the Fire Brigade for their help in rescuing the dog.
