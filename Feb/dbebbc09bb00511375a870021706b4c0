Motorists should avoid the road between Hendrina and Wonderfontein after an irrigation dam wall broke and the consequent flood washed the entire road surface away.  The crevice left by the flood would swallow a truck.  According to a farm worker the dam wall of an irrigation dam gave in.  The dam was one of the biggest on the farm.  Residents say there the roads are generally in a state of disrepair. The road has been cordoned off by tape, but farmers fear that unsuspecting motorists may drive into peril. The situation is beyond quick repair. It will cost millions in disaster funds to repair the route.  Mpumalanga has already been declared a disaster zone by national government due to damages caused by escalating weather patterns. As rains persist, more damage to Mpumalanga roads are expected, and drivers should remain on high alert.
