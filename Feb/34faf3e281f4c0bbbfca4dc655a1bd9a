The Steve Tshwete Boarding School sadly can’t use their sports field to train for athletics due to overgrown grass. The school’s grass cutter broke in January making the school sports field unusable. The school’s principal, Matsobane Lebelo, said only seven of their 47 athletes will be competing this Friday at Steelcrest High School, the rest can’t go because they were unable to receive the necessary training. The school is appealing to a good Samaritan to aid them to cut their overgrown grass so that their learners can practice track and hopefully compete with other schools in the area. Please connect Mr Matsobane Lebelo on 074 363 1141 for more details.
