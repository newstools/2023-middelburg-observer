That is the question motorists asked when they saw a police van next to the road on February 14. “I couldn’t believe what I saw,” one motorist said, “Aren’t the police supposed to have a garage centre where they take their vehicles to when there is something wrong with an exhaust?” • Brig. Selvy Mohlala (Provincial Spokesperson) said that vehicle was there after attending a protest action where tyres were burned. “In the process the wires of the tyres hook under the vehicle between the propshaft. As the member was driving, it created an uncomfortable noise. He stopped there so that he could be able to remove the wires under the vehicle. It was a good gesture of responsibility and care from the member.”
