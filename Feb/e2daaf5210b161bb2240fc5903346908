A well-known tenderpreneur, who can not be identified due to obvious safety reasons, was targeted in two separate incidents. Last Saturday, whilst he was driving out of his driveway in Siyathuthuka with his two young daughters, two armed men opened fire on his car.
The man told his young children to run for safety whilst he was being attacked by the unknown men. The children thought their father had passed away when they saw the blood pool near his vehicle.
The victim was allegedly shot at by a 9mm pistol and a hunting rifle. An eyewitness who saw the incident quickly contacted the police.
The victim sustained injuries to his hip and one hand. Paramedics rushed him to the Belfast Hospital from where he was transferred to another hospital.
He has since been relocated to a place of safety. • On February 14, at about 07:00, his home in Siyathuthuka was damaged by explosives. According to Brigadier Selvy Mohlala the police found bricks, glass and tiles scattered inside the house.
They also found wires outside the property, indicating explosives were used. A malicious damage to property case has since been opened. No arrests have been made yet. • The two incidents are allegedly linked to a mining tender in the area. An attempted murder docket was opened by the Belfast Police.
