A white Toyota Avanza, used as a courier van, which was hijacked on 14 February at Komati, Blinkpan and was reportedly recovered in Clewer near Emalahleni. In addition, a suspect was arrested on the same day near Witbank thanks to the collaborative work of a car tracker company, Middelburg Flying Squad Unit of the SAPS, and Vispol members from Witbank SAPS. According to the report, law enforcement agencies immediately activated their resources in pursuit of the suspects after the vehicle was hijacked. The car tracker company played a pivotal role as they alerted other stakeholders including the SAPS members about the incident. Members proceeded to Clewer near Witbank where they all assembled. A white Toyota Avanza with Mpumalanga registration number plates was spotted with one occupant. The car was tactically approached and the occupant cornered. After conducting a search of the vehicle, the team realized that the car was the hijacked vehicle that they were looking for. The team managed to recover some of the items which were allegedly stolen during the hijacking of the courier van as well as one pistol of which the suspect produced the license thereof. The police are of the view that the suspect could have perhaps used these firearms during the hijacking incident. The suspect was subsequently arrested and is expected to appear at the Emalahleni Magistrateâ€™s Court today, (Wednesday, 15 February) facing a charge of possession of suspected stolen properties. The suspect could be linked to the said hijacking incident and at this stage the police cannot rule out the possibility of adding more charges against the suspect as the investigation continues. The Provincial Commissioner of the SAPS in Mpumalanga, Lieutenant General Semakaleng Daphney Manamela has applauded the efforts displayed by various stakeholders which produced the desired outcome especially in the fight against theft, robbery and hijacking of vehicles in the province.
