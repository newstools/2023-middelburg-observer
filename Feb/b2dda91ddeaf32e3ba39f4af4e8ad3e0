According to Mr. Ismail Jooma, Chairman of the CPF sector 1.1 in Eastdene a relative was forced to a stop at the Cowen Ntuli and Wicht Street intersection by a black BMW X Series containing four male suspects, one of which was armed. The woman managed to get away, and the BMW was last seen driving down Wicht Street into Koets Street. The incident happened so quickly that the BMW’s registration plates could not be determined. It contained mine lights on the roof. “We sent an alert to the CPF hoping to warn residents, but it happened so quickly that we had no time to react,” Mr. Jooma concluded.
