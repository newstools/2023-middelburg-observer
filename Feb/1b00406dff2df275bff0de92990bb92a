Ongoing downpours have resulted in the Middelburg Dam levels standing at 100% with a sluice gate being left open since Friday. According to a public notice issued by the Steve Tshwete Local Municipality, one of the sluice gates will be left open at 300 mm to lower dam levels, which are currently standing at over 100% full. Mr. David Nonyana, supervisor at the Middelburg Dam, confirmed yesterday that a sluice gate has been open since Friday. Due to a high intake over the weekend, a second sluice gate was temporarily opened to stabilise water pressure. Residents and farmers in low lying areas have been warned of rising water levels in low-lying areas due to the open sluice gates.
