Bosman Grobler and Morgan Bruiners, two prominent DA politicians from Middelburg, have been elected as the Chairman and Deputy Chairman for Mpumalanga. The announcement was made a short while ago at Olifants River Lodge who played host to hundreds of eligible party representatives from every corner of the province. Though John Steenhuisen could not make the trip, conference goers were elated to welcome Helen Zille, the DA’s Federal Council Chairwoman. Zille was accompanied by DA Federal Chairman Ivan Meyer, DA Federal Deputy Chairwoman Refilwe Ntseke as well as former Mpumalanga DA bigwig James Masango who is Deputy Chairman of the DA’s Federal Council. Jane Sithole was, again, elected as Mpumalanga DA Leader.
