Annemarie Stander (55), was released on R5000 bail by the Standerton Magistrates Court yesterday, after she was arrested by the Middelburg Hawksâ€™ Serious Corruption Investigation team for fraud, theft and money laundering. The investigation revealed that during 2021, Eskom Tutuka Power Station issued an order to Umnandi Conference and Catering for the purchase and delivery of two containers to the power station. The company allegedly colluded with Eskom employees, and invoiced the power utility an amount of R939 550 without actually purchasing, and delivering, the containers. Payment was done, and Eskom suffered another fraudulent loss. The case was postponed to 20 February, when Stander will appear in the Middleburg Specialised Commercial Crimes Court. The accused will be added to the court docket of another three Eskom officials who, were arrested by Standerton detectives before the case was transferred to the Hawks for further investigation in January 2023.
