The winners were chosen by a panel made up of CEO’s, MD’s, business owners, company directors, managers and government officials based in Mpumalanga. PMR Africa is a consultancy and research company based in South Africa. • The purpose of their award ceremony is to create a platform where companies and institutions can be branded as entities with growing potential.
