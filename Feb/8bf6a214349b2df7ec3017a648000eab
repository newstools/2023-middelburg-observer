“The market is the first of our markets in 2023” said Munro Deysel, Organiser of the market. “We have many new vendors whom we welcome and who will help us make a big push for the Epilepsy Centre in Dullstroom which is our beneficiary. We invite the public to come out in full force to support this worthy cause. Visitors to the market are invited to bring any unused household items, used clothing, canned food, toiletries or anything else they want to donate.” Deysel emphasised. The market is divided into five sections: food court, arts and crafts, flea market, lifestyle and special exhibits. Over the last two years the Dullstroom Village Market has developed a reputation for its unique, high quality and home-made arts, crafts, lifestyle products, goods, and freshly made food. “We are building a high quality market reputation. We are not interested in being a same-old, same-old market.” For more information contact Munro at 082 075 4060.
