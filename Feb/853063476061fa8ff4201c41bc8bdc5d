The hunt for the four men seen carrying AK 47 rifles and driving a white Toyota bakkie without a registration plate, was called off after Police and members of the Middelburg Dagpatrollie found them in Christiaan de Wet Street in Dennesig. Mr Arthur Hill from Middelburg Dagpatrollie assured residents that the men are no cause for alarm, after they were identified as a registered Security Company from KZN. He further stated to group members that the men are security employed by a taxi association for protection. The Dennesig neighbourhood was called to attention earlier by their appearance, due to the suspicious circumstances they were seen driving around in. A search for the white Toyota double cab bakkie with only a front registration plate, and its four occupants wearing black clothing, balaclavas and carrying assault rifles then commenced.
