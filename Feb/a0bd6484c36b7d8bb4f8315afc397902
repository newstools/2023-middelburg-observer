The law enforcement agencies in Mpumalanga seems to be conquering the battle against theft, robbery and hijacking of vehicles in the province. This is evident by the arrest of a 44-year-old male suspect. Credit should be given to Middelburg Flying Squad, and a tracking company, which managed to gather information regarding a stolen Ford Ranger double cab bakkie.  The crucial information was shared with SAPS members from Middelburg Flying Squad. A joint sting operation between the SAPS and the car tracker company was then conducted. The vehicle was spotted with one occupant at Schoenland near Vosman outside Witbank.  The suspect was arrested for possession of suspected stolen motor vehicle and the bakkie was impounded. The suspect is expected to appear at the eMalahleni Magistrateâ€™s Court.
