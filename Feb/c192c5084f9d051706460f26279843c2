The drama which had Dennesig alert, unfolded after the vehicle skipped a four-way stop, and a Sector 4 member drove after them and forced them to stop. When the member approached the Toyota, the armed men wound down their vehicle’s window and pointed one of the assault rifles at him. His wife, who was in the vehicle, pleaded with him to leave the matter, because the couple were dropping children off at school. After the member returned to his own vehicle, he dispatched a mayday on the Sector 4 group, alerting the neighbourhood of the vehicle, resulting in several members giving chase and alerting the SAPS. Both authorities and volunteers pursued the Toyota, which continued its attempt at evading the police. “We really want to commend the SAPS for their quick response and assistance, because they continued their pursuit until the men, who were later confirmed to be security, were traced down in Christiaan de Wet Street.” When the occupants finally came out of the house, they were dressed in black but had no weapons on them.
When asked why they sped off, one man allegedly said “with this job you don’t trust nobody”. The members also later corrected that the weapons were not AK 47’s but definitely assault rifles. “The questions to ask is, why did they flee from the police, why were they carrying assault rifles, and why did they point it at a member of the public?”
