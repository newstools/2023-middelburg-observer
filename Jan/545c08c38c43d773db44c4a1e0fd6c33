According to DA Ward Councillor, Hennie Niemann, a number of complaints has been received from residents believing that the container is an illegitimate business being operated near the Klein Olifants low water bridge. Cllr. Niemann explained that the container is a site camp for contractors who have been sourced by the Steve Tshwete Local Municipality, to reseal road surfaces in Middelburg. “We wish to notify members of the public that the road surfaces across Middelburg will be resealed, and the container has been erected there due to it’s central location. Residents have no cause for concern.”
