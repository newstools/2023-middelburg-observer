Both men have been released on R2000 bail and will appear in court again on March 28. The arrests were made for the alleged contravention of environmental impact laws pertaining to an illegal coal yard.
Coal to the value of more than R500 000 is involved. According to police, the men could not produce the necessary permits and documentation for running the yard. However, Mr Masina says they have applied for the necessary permits and documentation which have not been issued due to bureaucratic red tape in the Department of Minerals and Energy. He further says their names will be cleared when the misunderstanding is cleared up in court. The charges comes on the back of a number of other arrests Wednesday by the Green Scorpions at two illegal coal yards close to Pienaar Dam. The owners of the smallholdings, and their personnel were all arrested.
Machinery and vehicles were also confiscated.
