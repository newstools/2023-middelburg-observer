According to Mr Arthur Hill from Middelburg Dagpatrollie, the break-in took place between 03:00 and 04:30 during which R32 000â€™s worth of merchandise was stolen. Mr Hill received a dispatch from Mr Dolf Coetzee from Dolf Autobox at roughly 11:00 today, informing him of the break-in. After a patrol of the area, a single bicycle was found in possession of a suspect, near the old grain silos in Oos Street. The bushes along the railway line were finecombed, resulting in the other eight bicycles being found about 20 metres away from the first one. Owner of Gas Cycle Works, Mr Yusuf Khotha, thanked Mr Hill, his team as well as the employees as Dolf Autobox for their reaction and assistance. The suspect and stolen bicycles were taken to the Middelburg Police Station by Mr Hill, on request of the SAPS, who replied that they did not have any vehicles available.
