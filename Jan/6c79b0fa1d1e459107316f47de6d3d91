William Sengwe Matseding (63) fell from the dam wall on Monday morning. According to reports, Mr Matseding was throwing a chain block when it wrapped around his legs before pulling him to the ground.
He reportedly fell 30m to the ground before dying on impact. The father of two started working at the municipality in 1988, his wife Christina described him as a loving father. His wife questioned why her elderly husband was working on the dam wall without a harness ,“No one has been able to give us answers from the municipality,” the distressed woman said. She also said no one from the municipality has spoken to her about the incident. The municipality did, however, hold a memorial service at the Eric Jiyane Hall on Friday with a handful of the workers in attendance. Mr Matseding will be laid to rest on Sunday in Limpopo.
