Jan Vermaak (42) was killed whilst cycling on the R104 between Bronkhorstspruit and Balmoral on 6 December. According to a family member, the Bronkhorstspruit SAPS is on the lookout for a silver BMW, X Series, which is believed to have sustained considerable damage to the front bumper, left headlight and side mirror. “Jan was struck about 19 km out of Bronkhorstspruit on the R104. We believe he was hit somewhere between 08:00 and 09:00 in the morning, because the police were informed about the accident at 09:00.”  A reward of R35000 is now being offered by the family for information that could lead to the arrest of the driver. Jan is survived by his wife and two young children and was a well-loved member of the eMalahleni cycling community before relocating to Bronkhorstspruit.
