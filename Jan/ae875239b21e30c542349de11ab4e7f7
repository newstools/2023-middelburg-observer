An eyewitness spoke to the Middelburg Observer on the scene and said she saw the body being dragged across the low-water bridge, over another flood wall, to where it came to rest between branches of a tree. A police diver, flanked by fire and rescue personnel, braved the tumultuous stream to retrieve the body. It’s unclear when, how and where the possible drowning took place, as the body was washed quite a distance downstream, as told by the witness. Police have opened an inquest docket. Spectators have been asked to avoid the area as investigations are underway. • More details in this week’s Middelburg Observer.
