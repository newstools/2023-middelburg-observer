The accident took place at the entrance to Laerskool Uitkyk, after the bakkie involved had to slam on breaks for a dangerous pothole. The truck which was carrying a shipment of highly explosive ammonium nitrate ploughed into the bakkie, overturning and spilling itâ€™s load. According to Louwtjie Swart from Van Wettens Towing Services, the road will be closed while a clean-up of the scene commences. Motorists are advised to use alternative routes.
