A screaming client sent three armed robbers fleeing Touch of Gold empty handed. The three armed men entered Touch of Gold minutes ago in the CBD. A client however managed to flee the shop and scream for help outside, before the robbers abandoned their brazen plan, and fled. Police rushed to the mall where a second shop is located. The incident, however, occurred in the CBD, where Touch of Gold had had its seat for many decades. Luckily the robbers fled without harming anyone. Police have urged shop owners to be extra vigilant over the post-Christmas period as many shops now offer specials and discounts.
