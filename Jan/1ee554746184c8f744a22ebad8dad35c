Morney Vos from Specialised Security Services has just confirmed with the Middelburg Observer that Luschka Taljaard (27) has not gone missing but chose to disappear with her son Daniel. Vos explained that the footage at their disposal clearly shows how Luschka abandoned the VW Polo that was found outside the Kwazamokuhle township before climbing into a silver double cab bakkie with her son and another driver. “All of our teams are out in full force trying to locate Luschka,” Vos said. Investigator Vos is urging Luschka or anyone who is aware of their whereabouts to contact himself or Mike Bolhuis to confirm her and Daniel’s safety. “We will handle all information confidentially and won’t disclose their whereabouts as long as we can confirm that Luschka and Daniel are safe.” Investigator Morney Vos can be contacted on 066 212 5193 or alternatively Mike Bolhuis can be contacted on 082 447 6116.
