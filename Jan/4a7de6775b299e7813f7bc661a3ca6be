A public notice issued by the Steve Tshwete Local Municipality is being shared by residents of Dennesig and Kanonkop, confirming that the municipality is fighting a battle against acts of theft and vandalism to municipal infrastructure during load-shedding. The notice appealed to residents to assist in monitoring vulnerable areas where such thefts are frequently experienced. The notice reads as follows: “The Municipality is currently experiencing cable theft and vandalism during load shedding. This causes uncontrolled power outages in certain areas, which takes longer to repair and causes a huge financial impact on the municipality’s repairs and maintenance budget. The community is encouraged to play a role in curbing cable theft and vandalism of infrastructure during load shedding, by patrolling or monitoring of vulnerable sites in your respective wards. This practice is working perfectly in other areas within the municipality. Our law enforcement officers and security guards are working tirelessly to patrol and monitor the substations, however it is impractical for them to patrol all the areas at the same time. Working together will make a difference. Report any vandalism activity to our law enforcement officers on 082 501 1879.”
