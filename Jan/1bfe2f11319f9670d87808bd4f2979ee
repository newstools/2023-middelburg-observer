Dr Reg van Rensburg has debunked misinformation that is inciting panic about the new variant, saying that it will likely pass like the general flu. Dr Van Rensburg explained that Middelburg has seen no cases as yet, meaning local physicians have no first-hand experience of its effects, “However, I am of the personal opinion that the new variant isn’t something to panic about and that wearing masks will be unnecessary.” The Minister of Health, Dr Joe Phaahla, also stated in a press release that no new lockdown restrictions or wearing of masks will be implemented in South Africa. While the new variant has been informally labelled as ‘Kraken’ by some physicians due to its ability to spread so far, it remains a subvariant of Omicron with two new mutations allowing its transmissibility. It has been detected in 28 different counties so far.
