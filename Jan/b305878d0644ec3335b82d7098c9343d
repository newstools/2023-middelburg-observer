Weary patients in need of medical treatment arrived at an indisposed Eastdene Clinic which found itself without electricity for two days this week. A reliable source confirmed that staff members arrived at the clinic on Monday where the power was off. Whether patients were assisted without electricity for two days could not be confirmed, as the source divulged that the outage was only reported on Tuesday. After the Steve Tshwete Local Municipality was informed, a generator had to be arranged to allow business to continue before the electricity was finally restored on Thursday. • Parts of Dennesig was also plunged into darkness since last night 22:00, with electricity only being restored a while ago. DA Ward Councillor, Johann Dyason, owed the outage to a possible cable theft after a loud bang was reportedly heard near the Saverite Centre. Cllr. Dyason said that the municipal electrical department have thus far been inundated by reparations at one of the water treatment plants. “Middelburg CBD has experienced water interruptions for over three weeks and restoring water to the area has taken priority. Once the electricians are finished there, they will tend to other power outages.”
