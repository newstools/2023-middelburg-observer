Baboon spotted in Kanonkop yet again! Sighted by neighbours in a residents front yard tree, the baboon appears docile at the moment. Perched in a treetop high above the ground, the baboon is settling in for the night. Wildlife expert Deon Cornelius recognised the baboon as the same creature as previously seen in the Kanonkop, as well as the Aerorand area. Deon and his team will attempt to dart the animal tomorrow, to avoid any unnecessary casualty of life.
